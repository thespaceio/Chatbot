# 🤖 My Own AI Assistant

Welcome to my personal AI project — a step-by-step journey into building an intelligent, friendly chatbot from the ground up using Python. No pre-trained models, no frameworks. Just curiosity, code, and a little humor. 🧠✨

This isn’t just a chatbot — it’s **my first AI**, designed to learn, interact, and grow with every conversation.

## 🌟 Features

- 💬 **Natural Conversations**  
  Responds to greetings, questions, thanks, and farewells with context-aware replies.

- ⏰ **Time & Date Awareness**  
  Knows the current time and date — and greets you like a real human (Good morning, afternoon, or evening!).

- 🧮 **Math Calculations**  
  Can perform basic math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — just type `5 + 3`!

- 😊 **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Uses `TextBlob` to detect if your message is positive, negative, or neutral — and responds with empathy.

- 🧑‍💼 **Remembers Your Name**  
  Say “My name is Tunde” — and the bot will remember and use it in future replies.

- 🇳🇬 **Nigerian-Themed Jokes**  
  Packed with local humor that’ll make you laugh (or at least smile). Only in Nigeria! 😂

- 🔍 **Entity Detection**  
  Picks out numbers, emails, and URLs from your input — a small step toward deeper understanding.

## 🚀 How It Works

Built with core Python libraries:
- `nltk` – for language processing
- `TextBlob` – for sentiment analysis
- `re` – for pattern matching and math parsing
- `datetime` – for time/date logic

The bot uses rule-based logic, keyword matching, and light NLP to understand and respond — all in a clean, readable class structure.

## 🖥️ Try It Yourself

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install textblob nltk
   ```

3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

Say `hello`, ask for the time, tell a joke, or test your math — and see how it responds!

> 💡 Tip: Type `exit` to end the conversation.

## 🌱 What’s Next?

I’m continuously improving this AI. Future plans include:
- Saving user preferences across sessions
- Adding voice input/output
- Supporting Pidgin English and local languages
- Training a custom NLP model
- Web interface (Flask/Django) or mobile app

## 🤝 Want to Help?

Contributions are **super welcome**! Whether you want to:
- Add new responses
- Improve logic or NLP
- Contribute more Nigerian jokes
- Fix bugs
- Suggest features

…there’s a place for you here. Let’s build something smart, fun, and uniquely ours — together.
